<h1>Hello, I'm Patricio ðŸ˜Ž</h1>

<p>
    Hello, thanks for visiting my profile. My name is Patricio Rojas, a hybrid cloud engineer at Udacity (initially graduated as a computer engineer with a degree in Business Process Management from the Federico Santa MarÃ­a Technical University Chile). In recent years, I have managed to work in a remote way, updating my technical knowledge as well as the soft skills that allow me to interact appropriately in a productive way, applying personal values â€‹â€‹and principles.
</p>

<p>
    My knowledge of technology for around 20 years, in different profiles and problems, allows me to reliably carry out a sustainable change control in the vertical technical infrastructure, as well as in the horizontal optimization of business processes.
</p>

<p>
    I enjoy working in the hybrid cloud with the Nutanix infrastructure (Prism Central, Prism Element, AcrÃ³polis, Blueprints, etc.), mainly using Linux, and with some of the databases like Sybase, MariaDB, MySQL. I develop web applications, mainly in PHP language, using the complete cycle of web tooling automation tools.
</p>
